1. <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word">Municipal HSS, Hastinapuram</p>

3. <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word">Govt. HSS, Zamine Pallavaram</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word">Our work with these schools consists of 3 broad types of activities:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word">A. Providing assistance to the students of Class 11 and 12 in their subjects of study such as Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Computer Science, English. For this our Fellows from MIT visit the schools during 4.30 – 6.00 PM on working days and engage with the students who have been identified by the schools.
